# Introducing: Quotebacks
> I have created a Keyboard Maestro script that takes the current Safari Tab and uses Bret Terpstra’s [heckyesmarkdown.com 28](http://heckyesmarkdown.com/) service to generate a markdown version of the page (in readability mode) and then paste the Markdown Content of the page.
> 
> I have a keyboard combination assigned to it. My workflow is to create a new note in Obsidian, hit the keyboard combination, wait a second or so, then copying and pasting the page title into the Obsidian title field. (This could be automated as well, but I ran out of time ![:smiley:](https://forum.obsidian.md/images/emoji/apple/smiley.png?v=9 ":smiley:"))
> 
> The script – and /today and /tom(orrow) helper scripts – is available on GitHub: [https://github.com/yatil/obsidian-helpers/releases/tag/0.1 39](https://github.com/yatil/obsidian-helpers/releases/tag/0.1)

# Roam-highlighter 356



## \- [[Roam-highlighter]](https://github.com/GitMurf/roam-highlighter/)

Named before the author discovered Obsidian, but configurable to work quite nicely with any markdown tool. This one has a lot of unique features, such as being able to define words as wiki links on the clipboard before copying. Super configurable, and loads of formatting options. The author, [@smurfman111](https://forum.obsidian.md/u/smurfman111) , has been very responsive in working with the Obsidian community to make using this extension just as easy for us. You can find his post about it [here 157](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/web-clipper-highlighter-and-kindle-highlights-notes-extraction-extension/852).

## \- [Markdownizr :: Chrome Extension ](https://www.markdownizr.com/)

Markdownizer extracts markdown from the selected area of a web page and formats it as markdown on your clipboard. Not really designed for quoting, as it does not by default include a link to the page. But it does have the option to strip out specific html tags, which can be really useful.

Quotebacks takes a slightly different approach, as it’s focused around the idea of sharing quotes via open web technologies. It has the option to export a nicely-formatted html embed of the clip. But it will also do markdown, and its formatting gets along nicely with Obsidian. Also it keeps a record of all of the clips you’ve made in local browser storage, so you have an ongoing list in your browswer of things you’ve clipped.
